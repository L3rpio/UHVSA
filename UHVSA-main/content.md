## About UH VSA

---

Founded in 1979, the Vietnamese Student Assocation at the University of Houston
aims to preserve and promote the Vietnamese
culture while allowing its members to meet new people and socialize. Being an organization that serves such a large and diverse community, we give our members an opportunity to join families, which are smaller groups of our members that share similar interests and hobbies. UH VSA also gives our members an opportunity to work on their leadership and teamwork skills with our internship program, where we allow a select group of members to work along side with our officers! Whether you're looking for a social, cultural, or skill building experience, UH VSA welcomes people from all sorts of backgrounds and strives to make it a inclusive and safe space for its members.
